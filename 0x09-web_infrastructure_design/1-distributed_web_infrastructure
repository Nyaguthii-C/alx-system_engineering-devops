- Addittional servers increase highh availability for the website www.foo.barby increasing redundancy incase one server goes down.  
- The load balancer is added to distribute the website's incoming traffic among the available servers . This is to avoid overloading a single server.  
- There is additional database toeliminate a SPOF and provide ease of recovery in case of failure of one database.    
- Dynamic Round Robin distribution algorithm is used on the load balancer. 
This distributes the incoming traffic accoring to the capability of a given server in time of response time, number of connections
and speed. There is continous monitoring and the prefernce keeps changing.
Database Primary-Replica cluster uses replication to keep the data synchronized.  
- The primary node accepts read and write while Replica node accepts read only.  
- The load balancer is the SPOF. The entire system depends on a single load balancer that may compromise the website's functioning in case of failure.
- This design lacks monitoring,https and firewall. This compromises the security of data being transferred as it lacks encryption, exposes the server to harm
due to the lack of a firewall and without monitoring it is hard to identify if everything is functioning as it is supposed to.
